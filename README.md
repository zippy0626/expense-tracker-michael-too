# Expense Tracker

## Overview
A better personal expense tracker to give insights on how your money could be better spent!

## Problem Statement

Current expense tracking tools are often tedious, inaccurate, and costly. They require manual data entry, lack free access for users, and provide limited or mediocre data visualization, making it hard to manage and understand personal finances effectively.

**Other tools**
- Manual data entering and calculations
- Some not free for users, need to pay/subscribe
- Data visualization is mediocre/none at all

## Target Users
- Students looking for a way to manage budgets
- Young professionals starting to track their income/expenses
- Anyone seeking better insight into personal finances

## Core Features (MVP)
**Ver. 0.1**
- Handling and parsing of .csv bank statement files
- Expense data visualization (charts and timelines by criteria) 
- Weekly and monthly summaries of spending habits 
- Search and filtering expenses by criteria
